                                <p>The Eighth Avenue Line is the original rapid transit line of the Independent Subway System (IND), now run by the New York City Transit Authority as part of the New York City Subway system. For more than three decades from its inception in 1932, many New Yorkers called the entire IND system the Eighth Avenue Subway. Although it was the first portion of the IND put into service, this was never its official name.</p>
                                
                                <p> Most of the line is quadruple-tracked (with one local and one express track in each direction), except for the extreme north and south ends (which have just two tracks). The northern section of the Eighth Avenue Line (above 145th Street) was once designated the Washington Heights Line (entrance signage read "Wash. Hgts.-8th Av."). For this reason, some A trains (R32 and R38 only) have rollsigns designations that read "Washington Heights–8 Avenue–Fulton Street".</p>

It is used by the L service, which is shown in the color gray on the NYC Subway map and on station signs.It is also occasionally referred to as the Eastern District Line. </p>
                                
                                <p>This refers to Williamsburg, which was described as Brooklyn's "Eastern District" when the City of Williamsburg was annexed by the former City of Brooklyn. This was the location where the original Brooklyn subway portions of the line were laid out. Only later was the line connected to the tracks leading to Canarsie. Eastern District High School preserves this toponym.</p>

                                <p>The Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, also known as the West Side Line, is one of the lines of the IRT division of the New York City Subway. It runs along the west side of Manhattan and into the Bronx; the part north of 42nd Street was built as part of the first subway in New York. The line serves places such as Lincoln Center, Columbia University, and the City College of New York.</p>
                                
                                <p>The line is often referred to as the 1–2–3, since the 1, 2, and 3 services operate together over much of the line. The line sees 3 service limited rush hours in the peak direction (two trains heading to Brooklyn and four trains heading to the Bronx) to clear congestion. In the past, the 1 operated as a skip-stop service in tandem with the 3, which was discontinued after May 27, 2005; this skip-stop service existed only in upper Manhattan during rush hours.</p>

                                <p>The Lexington Avenue Line (sometimes called the Lex, the 4-5-6 or the IRT East Side Line) is one of the major IRT lines in the New York City Subway. A large segment of it used to be part of the first subway line in New York. Being the only line in Manhattan to directly serve the Upper East Side and East Midtown, the four-track IRT Lexington Avenue Line is the most crowded in the country.</p>
                                
                                <p> Its average of 1.3 million daily riders is "more than the combined ridership of San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston's entire transit systems." (Second Avenue Subway FEIS, p. 1–6). Its ridership also exceeds that of the 614,000 daily trips on the entire Washington Metro (SAS FEIS, p. 1–5). The Second Avenue Line has been proposed to fix this problem.</p>

                                 <p>Several stations along this line have been abandoned. When platforms were lengthened to fit 10 cars, new entrances were built for adjacent stations, making the abandoned ones redundant. For example, 14th Street-Union Square has an entrance on 16th, and 23rd Street has an entrance on 20th, so 18th Street station was abandoned.</p>

                                <p>The Flushing Line is a rapid transit route of the New York City Subway system, operated as part of the IRT Division and designated the 3 route. It runs from Flushing in Queens to Times Square in Manhattan, carrying trains of the 3 local service (as well as the express <i>7</i> rush hours in the peak direction), and is assigned the color purple. Before the line was opened all the way to Flushing, it was known as the Corona Line or Woodside and Corona Line.</p>

Express trains run to Manhattan from 06:30 to 12:30 and from Manhattan from 12:30 to 22:00. Some express trains run especially for New York Mets and U.S. Open games.</p>
